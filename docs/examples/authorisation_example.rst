Initial Authorisation
=====================


Internal Seller Access
----------------------

To gain initial access to the Api you will need to follow the authorisation process as documented by
Amazon https://github.com/amzn/selling-partner-api-docs/blob/main/guides/en-US/developer-guide/SellingPartnerApiDeveloperGuide.md

This involves two main stages:

- Adding an App to your Seller Central account.
- Configuring Python-SPAPI with the correct credentials.

Configuring the App in Seller Central:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::
    **To add an App to your Seller central account you must be logged in the account owner.**

Overview:

- Seller Central -> Partner Network -> Develop Apps.
- Add a new client app
- Click the `LWA Credentials View` link to see your `Login With Amazon` credentials.
- Click *Authorise* and copy the `REFRESH_TOKEN` that is provided to you. *This is your only chance to see this token!, you will nee to regenerate it if you lose it.*


Configuring Python SPAPI.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using the credentials dict as our example (Note you can use file or environment variables):

The following is an overview of which credentials go with which key.

- `refresh_token` -> This is from Seller Central, Authorisation of the app window
- `lws_app_id` -> This is from Seller central under LWA client credentials -> Client Identifier and will look like `amzn1.application-oa2-client.7b18cd......`
- `lwa_client_secret` -> This is from Seller central under LWA client credentials -> Client Secret and will look like `b5f7f8...`

.. code-block:: python

    credentials = dict(
        refresh_token='your_refresh_token',  # From Seller central under Authorise -> Refresh Token
        lwa_app_id='your_lwa_app_id',  # From Seller Central, named CLIENT IDENTIFIER on website.
        lwa_client_secret='your_lwa_client_secret',  # From Seller Central, named CLIENT SECRET on website.
    )
